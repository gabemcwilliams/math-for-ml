# Math for Machine Learning

This repo documents my handwritten LaTeX and NumPy-based notes from foundational math topics that support data science and machine learning.

Topics covered:
- Linear Algebra (matrix products, nullspace, rank)
- Probability & Stats (distributions, regression, sampling)
- Hypothesis Testing
- RREF and Gaussian Elimination (step-by-step)

These notebooks were built from hours of coursework (Udemy: Krista King) and expanded with my own annotations and code examples. The goal is both study and future reference as I deepen into ML.

> This repo is part of my larger effort to solidify my understanding before building advanced ML/AI systems.
